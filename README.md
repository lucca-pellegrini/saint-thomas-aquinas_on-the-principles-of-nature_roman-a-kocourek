# On the Principles of Nature

By Saint Thomas Aquinas  
Translated by Roman A. Kocourek

This is a Standard Ebooks edition of St. Thomas Aquinas's philosophical
treatise _On the Principles of Nature, to Brother Sylvester_, originally
written in 1255.

The work delves into key Aristotelian-Thomistic concepts such as act and
potency, matter and form, generation, and corruption, providing a foundational
exploration of natural philosophy.

This edition fills a gap in available formats, as existing English PDFs were
inadequate and no ePUB version existed. It is based on [the excellent HTML
transcription](https://isidore.co/aquinas/DePrincNaturae.htm) by Fr. Joseph
Kenny, O.P., created in 2010 for the [Dominican House of Studies in
Washington, D.C.](https://dhs.edu/), and further refined by the [Aquinas
Institute](https://www.aquinasinstitute.org/) for their online collection at
[aquinas.cc](https://aquinas.cc/).

Produced by Lucca Pellegrini using Standard Ebooks tools and style guide.
